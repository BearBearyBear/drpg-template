# Discord Sapphire Bot Template

## Features

-   Typescript
-   Sapphire Framework

## Getting Started

1. Copy `.env.example` and rename it to `.env` (this will store all your sensitive config info, and will be _ignored_ by Git)
2. Provide your Bot Token, Owner ID, and Log Channel, options.

## Other info

-   You may see several references to 'Drpg' - Discord RPG Community. This is a sort of "brand"/community that I've created - mostly for myself, that follow this same framework and patterns, and has shared common utilities (DRPG-Logger and DRPG-Utils).
