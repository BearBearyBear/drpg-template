# Discord Sapphire Bot Template

## Features

-   Typescript
-   Sapphire Framework

## Commands

By default, a couple of commands are provided, with several aliases for each

-   `^ping` ~hails a cab~ duh
-   `^help` views the custom IDrpgCommandOptions decorator on each object. Provide a command name or alias
-   `^buttontest` embeds and buttons, with a random number generator baked into it as an example

## Getting Started

1. Copy `.env.example` and rename it to `.env` (this will store all your sensitive config info, and will be _ignored_ by Git)
2. Provide your Bot Token, Owner ID, and Log Channel, options.

## Other info

-   You may see several references to 'Drpg' - Discord RPG Community. This is a sort of "brand"/community that I've created - mostly for myself, that follow this same framework and patterns, and has shared common utilities (DRPG-Logger and DRPG-Utils).
